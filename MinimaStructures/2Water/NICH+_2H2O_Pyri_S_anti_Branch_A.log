 TERENCE, THIS IS STUPID STUFF:
 YOU EAT YOUR VICTUALS FAST ENOUGH;
 THERE CAN'T BE MUCH AMISS, 'TIS CLEAR
 TO SEE THE RATE YOU DRINK YOUR BEER.
 BUT OH, GOOD LORD, THE VERSE YOU MAKE,
 IT GIVES A CHAP THE BELLY-ACHE.
 THE COW, THE OLD COW, SHE IS DEAD;
 IT SLEEPS WELL, THE HORNED HEAD:
 WE POOR LADS, 'TIS OUR TURN NOW
 TO HEAR SUCH TUNES AS KILLED THE COW.
 PRETTY FRIENDSHIP 'TIS TO RHYME
 YOUR FRIENDS TO DEATH BEFORE THEIR TIME.
 MOPING, MELANCHOLY MAD:
 COME PIPE A TUNE TO DANCE TO, LAD.
